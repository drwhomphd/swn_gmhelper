# Stars Without Number GM Helper

A set of python scripts to assist with GM tasks within the Stars Without Number tabletop RPG.

Note: These tools are based around the original Core Rulebook as I have yet to purchase a copy of the revised edition rules.

## Pre-Requisites
* Python (2.x or 3.x)
* A LaTeX Distribution (for LaTeX files)
* latexmk (for easy LaTeX compilation)

## LaTeX Templates

The best way to leverage the LaTeX templates are to copy the directory and give it the name of the sector you'd like to create. The tex files in the directory can be used to generate the documents required.
