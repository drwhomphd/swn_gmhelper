        "1": "Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism centered around individual settlements or kinship groupings. On 3 or less, zealous revolutionaries are successful in entrenching their own ideals; roll randomly on the government type table.",
        "2": "The government weathers the crisis without change.",
        "3": "A leader from among the feudal families rises to preeminence, conferring legitimacy on his or her descendants in a new Monarchy.",

        "6": "Individual feudal lords prove too weak to suppress the commoners, while those who embrace the popular will gain the benefit of their enthusiastic support. Over time, these rulers are effectively chosen by the populace, forming the core of a new Republic."
