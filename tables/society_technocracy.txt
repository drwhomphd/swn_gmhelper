        "1": "Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism centered around individual settlements or kinship groupings. On 3 or less, zealous revolutionaries are successful in entrenching their own ideals; roll randomly on the government type table.",
        "2": "The government weathers the crisis without change.",
        "3": "The technocracy gradually ceases to recruit outsiders, transforming into a closed Oligarchy.",
