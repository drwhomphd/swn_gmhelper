        "1": "Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism centered around individual settlements or kinship groupings. On 3 or less, zealous revolutionaries are successful in entrenching their own ideals; roll randomly on the government type table.",
        "2": "The government weathers the crisis without change.",
        "3": "The theocracy splinters into a Tribalism based around numerous local sects and hierarchies, which may or may not view each other kindly.",
        "4": "The theocracy gradually loses its religious legitimacy, becoming an Autocracy based on military or economic might shaded by a patina of religion.",

        "6": "The government gradually breaks up into multiple regional hierarchs, each of whom maintains Feudal rights over the surrounding faithful."
